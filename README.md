# Course Availability Monitor  

Classes fill up really quickly at UCLA. The program monitors full classes and sends me an email if a spot opens up. Contains the functionality of [Coursicle](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coursicle.coursicle) in one python script. Unlike Coursicle, the program does not charge $5 to monitor more than one class. So really it's much better than Coursicle. Specific to UCLA.
